# Discover
##### The ultimate digital audio guide    

Inspired by a vacation in Italy, Discover is an Android application that aims to revolutionize the way we consume audio guides at
tourist attractions and sites of natural and historic significance. Rather than resort to specialized hardware, users simply have to 
download the app, search for museums or sites of interest, download the guide and listen to the right audio at the right time using
NFC. To facilitate this, the service has been divided into two different applications: **Discover**, and **Discover Dev**.    

#### Discover Dev

Discover Dev allows administrative authorities at parks and museums to upload their audio guides to the Discover service and 
connect them to NFC tagsvia a straighforward interface on an Android phone. The authentication, accounts, and data storage 
were provided by Facebook's [Parse API](https://parse.com/). 

#### Discover

Discover is the application that museums or park visitors will use to look up audio guides or interest, download them, 
and consume them at the attraction via the NFC tags placed. 

#### Disclaimer

This was not intended to be a complete product in any way, and is certainly lacking in polish, stability and consistency. 
More than anything else, this was a learning exercise, and my first significant undertaking in software development. 
Over the development period, I learned (through no small amount of trial and error):

* What it means to design a project from scratch, and iteratively work towards a functional goal
* How to read the documentation of, and use an external API 
* How to use ListViews and NFC in Android, and
* The satisfaction that comes with finally getting something to work without crashing

#### Miscellaneous

I had also submitted the project described here to the Google Science Fair in May 2015. If you're interested in learning 
more about the research I had done and the tradeoffs I made, be sure to look at my thought process
